# hello-world
My first repository.

My name is Lilith (internet alias skyecrash) and I am a current sophomore Computer Science student with a general interest in software development and design. I'm always looking to learn new languages, and currently have a varying amount of experience in Java, C++, Python, HTML, and CSS.
